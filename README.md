# Comp 490 Project 1 - Primer Project/Simple.cgi 
         Status (working)

This is a simple web application for Comp 490 with Jeff Wiegley. It satisfies the minimum requirements I believe.

1. It responds to the GET verb.

2. It has a different response based upon the URI provided to the application. 

3. It returns HTML and links to one Cascading Style Sheet, on the csun server. 
  Url for css sheet:     http://www.csun.edu/fah36765/css/simple.css 
  
4. It consumes information from the file system. Prints the SCRIPT_FILENAME on the html page. 
         /home/users15/~fah36765/public_html/cgi-bin/simple.cgi

5. It consumes information from a remote web-server according to the URI provided in the query string. 

6. Web application url : http://www.csun.edu/~fah36765/cgi-bin/simple.cgi
